# Docker Live Application Debugging

At DockerCon 2016 Ananand Prasad demonstrated how to live debug a node application from Visual Studio Code.
A bit later he published a [blog post](https://blog.docker.com/2016/07/live-debugging-docker/) in which he described the steps that are needed to get a this working.

Looking at different editor and IDEs it seems that setting up a similar experience with other editors and programming language can be quite difficult.
Often there is no support there at all.

The mission of this repository is to collect different examples on how to get live debugging capabilities with Docker and your favourite IDE or editor.
